# Code of Conduct

Everyone at Wagtail Space US must agree with this code of conduct to attend any place (conference, workshop, party, hotels, Slack, social media, etc.) that is associated with Wagtail Space. Everyone means attendees, speakers, sponsors, Wagtail Space US organisers, volunteers, sketch noters, videographers, photographers, venue staff, etc.

This code of conduct will be enforced strictly; everyone is expected to cooperate so we can have a safe and inclusive event.

## Need Help?

If you have any questions about the Code of Conduct or need to report a violation/concern, please contact X or Y. You can direct message either or both of us privately through the Wagtail CMS Slack (where we discuss the event in the #wagtail-space-us channel) or approach us in person at the event.

You can also contact or approach any of the organisers, and they can contact us so you can get the help you're requesting.

When reporting an incident, please be as specific as possible with your contact info so we can reach you. It also helps to be detailed with as much information as possible, if you have it: names, witnesses, what happened, and any other context that can help.

If you need an escort or any other accommodations to feel safe or comfortable, please let us know so we can provide assistance.

## The Quick Version

Wagtail Space US is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sex, identity, expression, orientation, age, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, immigration status, family status, religion (or lack thereof), education, social class, economic class, or technology choices.
    
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 

When organisers receive a report, they will review what happened and document the resolution. Depending on the severity of the offense, anyone violating these rules will receive either a warning, expulsion from the event at the discretion of the Wagtail Space US organisers, banning from future events, or legal action (with the consent of the victim). If you receive a warning to stop harassing behavior, you must comply immediately.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sex, identity, expression, orientation, age, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, immigration status, family status, religion (or lack thereof), education, social class, economic class, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Wagtail Space US organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion with no refund, or banning from future Wagtail Space events.

Wagtail Space US organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Wagtail Space US organizer immediately. Organizers can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and Wagtail Space US-related social events.
