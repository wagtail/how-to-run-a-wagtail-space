# How to Run a Wagtail Space

## What is a Wagtail Space?

Wagtail Spaces are gatherings of enthusiasts of the Wagtail content management system for the Django web framework. There is no official format for a Wagtail space: to date, most have been a combination of speakers, sprints, and social events. Wagtail Spaces have been held across the world, in locations such as Bristol, England; Philadelphia, PA, USA; and Cape Town, South Africa.

The organizers of these events are providing this document as a set of best practices, lessons we have learned, and materials which will hopefully help make running future Wagtail Spaces a bit easier.
