# How to Run a Wagtail Space

## What is a Wagtail Space?

Wagtail Spaces are gatherings of enthusiasts of the Wagtail content management system for the Django web framework. There is no official format for a Wagtail space: to date, most have been a combination of speakers, sprints, and social events. Wagtail Spaces have been held across the world, in locations such as Bristol, England; Philadelphia, PA, USA; and Cape Town, South Africa.

The organizers of these events are providing this document as a set of best practices, lessons we have learned, and materials which will hopefully help make running future Wagtail Spaces a bit easier.

## Code of Conduct

Here's an [example code of conduct](example-coc.md), which you're welcome to adapt for your event.

## Venue Considerations

Finding the right venue can make all the difference in having an event that runs smoothly. Wagtail Spaces have been held in company offices and Universities. Having an organizer who is a member of the hosting organization is a good idea: they will likely be familiar with the layout of the venue, the technology available, and other resources available to keep things running smoothly.
